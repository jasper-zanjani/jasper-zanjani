## Hi there! 👋
I'm a polyglot and former linguist for the USG trying to make my way in tech!

### Quick reference to projects 👇
#### 🚀  [ Starships-py ](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/starships-py)
Toy project I developed while learning object-oriented techniques in Python that uses `Starship` and `Fleet` classes to represent.. well, fleets of starships. 
This type of project proved much more interesting than the typical pedantic scenarios that focus on cars, pizza, or the like.

A [ Powershell ](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/starships-pwsh) port is also available.

#### 💾 [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/ansible)
Ansible playbooks for distro-hopping. These simple playbooks ensure a few favorite tools of mine, like `vim` and associated plugins, will be present on any Linux distribution I use.
More interestingly, I have begun using these playbooks as a way to manage certain [dotfiles](#-dotfiles) like vimrc.

These playbooks use the `when` directive to incorporate conditional logic based on the value of different facts, like OS and environment variable values.
They are also well organized, separating concerns and establishing a healthy basis for future growth.

#### 📃 [ PDFCropper ](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/pdfcropper)
If there's one thing I hate, it's wasted margins on a printout!
This is a project that I have personally been using for a couple of years to remove extraneous margins from PDF textbooks from major vendors, like PacktPub and Manning.

#### 🖥 [ Dotfiles ](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/dotfiles)
Containing various dotfiles:
- .vimrc
- .bashrc
- i3 config
- others

#### 📝 [ Notes ](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/notes)
Copious notes on various technical topics, covering the gamut from [Linux](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/notes/blob/master/lx/README.md) and [Windows Server](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/notes/blob/master/win/70-740.md) certifications to programming languages like [Python](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/blob/maser/py/README.md) and [C#](https://github.com/jasper-zanjani/notes/blob/master/win/cs.md).
I always try to make an "artifact" of my learning in the form of a practical project, but if I am unable to then I've probably written some sort of note about it in this repo!
